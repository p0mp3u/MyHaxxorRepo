Repo with my hacking stuff
---

I am Pompeu, and I never thought that I would become a hacker. Growing up, I was always fascinated with technology, and my parents bought me my first computer when I was just six years old. I would spend hours playing games and exploring the different features of the machine.

As I got older, my interest in technology grew, and I started to learn more about programming and web development. However, it wasn't until I was in high school that I discovered the world of hacking.

It all started when I was browsing online forums and came across a group of hackers who were discussing their latest exploits. At first, I was just curious and read through their conversations without participating. But over time, I started to become more interested in their techniques and the thrill of breaking into computer systems.

I started to experiment with hacking tools and techniques, trying them out on my own computer and other devices around my home. At first, it was just harmless fun, but as I got better at it, I started to feel a sense of power and control that I had never experienced before.

It wasn't long before I started to explore more dangerous territory, breaking into websites and networks that belonged to companies and organizations. I never did it for financial gain or to cause harm, but rather for the challenge and the rush of adrenaline that came with each successful hack.

I started to spend more and more time online, joining forums and chat rooms where other hackers gathered to discuss their latest exploits. I was amazed by the level of knowledge and expertise that some of these individuals possessed, and I was eager to learn as much as I could.

Hacking is fun :D
